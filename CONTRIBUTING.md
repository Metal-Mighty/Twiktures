# Contributing to Twiktures 

Hi and welcome to Twiktures ! 

I'm happy to see that you are interested in contributing to this project. I will try to describe my goals, what can be contributed to and how to contribute.

## Goals
Twiktures was started as a learning project to learn how to work with the Blazor Framework as well as making a first contribution to the world of Open Source Softwares. 

The basic idea for Twiktures is to provide an easy way to get a quick glance at all the pictures posted on a Twitter account. With more features planned of course ðŸ™‚.

## What can I contribute on ?
As specified above, Twiktures is a way for me to learn new things, so I won't be able to accept contributions on all of its aspects. This list might be updated in the future when I feel like I have learnt enough about one specific aspect of the development.

tl;dr, I want to stay in charge of most of the development and governance of the project, but will accept small contributions on side-issues (bugfixes, typos, feature requests...)

### Things you **can** contribute to
* Quickfixes
* Feature requests
* Methodology and tools suggestions

## How to contribute
### Issues
Issue templates have been created in order to properly organize the different kind of issues and questions you may have. Please choose the correct template when creating an issue. If no template is adapted, please contact me on my socials or create a *Question* issue.

Please search existing issues prior to creating a new one to ensure it hasn't been discussed or solved before. It saves time for everyone!

### Contributions

More details below in the Pull Request section.

In any doubt, you can contact me on my socials or create a Question issue.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with your changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

* Fill the "Ready for review" template so that I can review your PR. This template helps to understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
* Don't forget to [link PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
* Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once submitted, I may ask questions or request for additional information.
* Changes might be requested to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
* As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
* If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
